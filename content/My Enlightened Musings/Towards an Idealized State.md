title: "Towards an Idealized State"

We live in a world with implicit and explicit borders and those where the structures fundamentally affect us more than we realize. 

My idea of an idealized state is one where humans have fundamental autonomy over where they can go/live/explore and truly be free. Hence idealized, because sadly I don't expect to see this in my lifetime. 

We are fundamentally pinned by situations that we haven't chosen, and this is a form of bondage. While yes, using that term and invoking images of slavery is extreme, 
there is something to be said about how we as humans are collectively living life being told it's perfectly fine that there are areas that we don't have access to 
without a good reason. 

## Point 1: The American Conundrum
The capitalist engine that America has been able to spread throughout the world has shown us that aggregating people densely can produce dangerous/beautiful and influential things. 

Ok, with that said... why this control and hard to extreme thing. Birth rates are declining in America, people who come immigrate to America are already self-filtering for theculture that fits this narrative yet the extreme stringent immigration policies follow through. 

The geographic sparseness of America and potential for multiplier on growth is a massive baffler. 

So here is one of my points: you have a huge amount of people that are willing to push your countries narrative and fundamentally live a suboptimal/caged life but yet there is an attempt to push that out. 

Ok stupid.
