# Why are People So Keen on Starting Families?

Familyhood is a fundamental strategy for ensuring personal survival and perpetuation of genes, rooted in evolutionary biology and reinforced by socio-cultural evolution. It posits that the human inclination towards forming familial bonds and structures is not merely a social construct but a deeply embedded evolutionary strategy aimed at maximizing reproductive success and ensuring the well-being and survival of offspring.

It almost seems like there is an evolutionary drive for self-protection and preservation that leads us to starting families. This intuitively makes sense when we think about how in the dire times, it’s our family that typically takes care of us or are more inclined to make personal sacrifices to tend to us.

## Introduction

Humans exhibit a strong inclination towards familyhood, a phenomenon that extends beyond social convention. The bonds that humans create seem to serve as critical mechanisms for ensuring personal survival, genetic perpetuation, and social cohesion.

## Evolutionary Background

The evolutionary doctrine suggests that the essence of existence hinges on reproduction—maximizing the spread and survival of one's genes. Simply put, we live to procreate. And we procreate to live.

However, this explanation alone does not fully account for the complex social structures and emotional bonds that characterize human familyhood. For thousands of years, humans have invested significant effort into building communities, from tribalistic groups in the hunter-gatherer era to structured societies like kingdoms.

## Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness

Kin selection theory posits that individuals are likely to perform altruistic acts for their relatives to ensure the survival of shared genes. This biological predisposition towards favoring kin can explain the tenacity of family bonds and the development of familial structures that support each other, especially in times of need. Inclusive fitness extends this idea by considering an individual's total genetic contribution to the next generation, including support provided to non-descendant kin, as a measure of evolutionary success.

## The Role of Social Structures in Evolution

Human societies have evolved to reinforce the biological imperatives of kin selection and inclusive fitness through social norms and structures that promote familyhood. Families provide a support system that enhances the survival chances of its members—through shared resources, protection, and knowledge transfer—thereby aligning with evolutionary goals.

## Tribalism and Protectionism

The formation of tight-knit family units can be seen as an extension of our tribalistic heritage, where belonging to a group provided protection against external threats and increased the chances of survival. This tribalistic instinct, when viewed through the lens of modern family structures, emphasizes the role of familial bonds in creating a protective environment conducive to raising offspring and supporting kin.

## Societal Implications and Support Systems

The role of the family extends into societal structures, where laws and social norms often prioritize familial relationships. Observations suggest that in times of crisis, family members are more likely to provide support, reinforcing the idea that strong family bonds serve as a hedge against adversity. This support mechanism not only benefits individuals but also contributes to the stability and resilience of societies.

## Conclusion

The pursuit of familyhood is deeply rooted in our evolutionary past, serving both biological imperatives and social necessities. By fostering strong kinship bonds, humans create supportive environments that enhance survival prospects, promote genetic continuity, and contribute to societal cohesion. This thesis underscores the importance of understanding familyhood not merely as a social construct but as a fundamental aspect of human nature, shaped by millions of years of evolutionary pressures and cultural evolution.
