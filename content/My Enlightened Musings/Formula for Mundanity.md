Many of us, at some point, have come to a realization: days can pass without us truly taking the time to think deeply. Of course, we're always engaged in some form of thought, but acting in a way that genuinely reflects our individual desires and choices seems increasingly rare.

Often, we find ourselves caught up in actions we feel obligated to perform. This sense of obligation doesn't necessarily make these actions unpleasant, but they do carry an automatic, unreflective quality. Whether it's work, completing tasks, or even socializing with friends, thereâ€™s an underlying notion of necessity. We might enjoy these activities, but they're often tinged with a sense of "I must do this."

Consider this from another angle: imagine the vast array of possible actions available to you at any moment. From a physicist's perspective, the number of choices we can make at any given time is virtually infinite. You could spontaneously decide to fly to New Orleans, drive five hours south, swim in a lake.

However, instead of embracing this limitless potential, we often feel compelled to make choices that "make sense." This leads to a repetitive, mundane pattern of behavior. Life, in its vast complexity, simply continues to unfold.

Interestingly, even planning a vacation can fall into the trap of mundanity. While the concept of a vacation is inherently exciting and offers something to anticipate, it's important to acknowledge that this, too, often aligns with societal expectations. Once we reach a certain financial threshold that enables exploration, embracing travel seems almost like a prescribed course of action. It becomes another item on the checklist of societal norms, rather than a spontaneous or deeply personal choice.

Breaking away from routine to genuinely evaluate every action of every day is an arduous task. In doing so, you will inevitably encounter aspects of your life that you dislike. There's also a good chance you'll deceive yourself, convincing yourself that certain actions are necessary. But the truth is, nothing is truly obligatory; it's more about our perception of necessity.
